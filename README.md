# UI/UX Design Planning.

# 1. Color Styles

Airbnb’s design relies on clean neutrals with a strong primary accent:

Primary (Accent): Airbnb Pink (#FF5A5F) → used for CTAs (buttons, highlights).

Secondary (Supportive Accents):

Teal Green (#00A699) → alternative CTA or highlights.

Blue (#007A87) → links, secondary emphasis.

Neutral Palette:

Dark Gray (#484848) → headings and body text.

Medium Gray (#767676) → secondary text.

Light Gray (#F7F7F7) → backgrounds.

White (#FFFFFF) → primary background.

# 2. Typography

Airbnb uses circular-inspired sans-serif fonts. In most clones, Inter, Helvetica, or Sans-serif is substituted.

Font Family: Circular (or Inter/Helvetica if unavailable).

Font Weights:

Light (300) → subtle text.

Regular (400) → body text.

Medium (500) → UI labels.

Bold (700) → headings, CTAs.

Font Sizes (responsive scaling):

Hero Heading: 32–40px (Bold).

Section Titles: 20–24px (Bold).

Body Text: 14–16px (Regular).

Captions / Small Labels: 12px (Regular).

Button Text: 14–16px (Medium/Bold).

# 3. Importance of Identifying Design Properties

When reviewing a mockup, extracting properties like color, typography, spacing, and component styles is critical because:

Consistency → Ensures all pages feel unified and professional.

Scalability → Easier to expand or modify design without breaking the style.

Handoff to Developers → Speeds up implementation with clear tokens (colors, fonts, spacing).

Accessibility → Helps check contrast ratios, font legibility, and color usage.

Efficiency → Prevents redundant design decisions, making collaboration smoother.
